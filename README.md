# Iris Dataset Classification with PCA and Machine Learning

This project explores the classification of the Iris dataset using dimensionality reduction (PCA) and multiple machine learning models. It demonstrates the application of various classifiers, hyperparameter tuning, and decision boundary visualization to evaluate model performance.

## Overview

The Iris dataset is reduced to two principal components using PCA for visualization and simplified classification. The following machine learning models are applied:
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Polynomial, Sigmoid, and RBF kernels with varying hyperparameters.
- **Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB)**: Different smoothing values.
- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**: Various configurations of solvers, activation functions, and hidden layer sizes.

## Key Features
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce data dimensions.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Models are trained on the PCA-reduced dataset and tested for accuracy.
- **Decision Boundary Visualization**: Visualizes how each model separates classes in 2D space.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiments with various hyperparameters for SVM, GNB, and MLP.

## Results
- Accuracy scores are displayed for each model on the test set.
- Decision boundaries for each model are plotted, providing insights into their classification performance.
